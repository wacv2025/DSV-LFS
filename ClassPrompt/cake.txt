The cake object class can be distinguished from other similar categories by its typically rounded or rectangular shape, often tiered or layered with visibly smooth, frosted surfaces. It frequently displays a variety of decorative elements such as intricate piping, edible flowers, fondant figures, and colorful sprinkles, which add to its ornate appearance. The cake's surface is often glossy or matte, depending on the type of icing used, with a sometimes visible crumb structure on the cut edges. The layers within a cake are usually distinct, separated by fillings like cream, fruit, or ganache, visible through slices. Cakes often feature a uniform, elevated height compared to flat desserts and are commonly adorned with celebratory text or numerals. The overall presentation is typically symmetrical, with a polished, finished look that indicates a level of craftsmanship and detail not usually seen in simpler baked goods like muffins or cookies.
