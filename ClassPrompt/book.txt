The book object class can be visually distinguished from other similar object categories by its characteristic rectangular shape, typically with a spine visible along one edge. Books often feature covers that vary in material (such as paper or leather) and design, including printed titles, images, or patterns. The pages within a book are discernible as a block when viewed from the side, often showing uniform edges. Unlike other objects, books commonly display a consistent arrangement of pages within their covers, contributing to their identifiable thickness and overall structure. Additionally, books may showcase a variety of sizes and proportions, from small pocket editions to large, coffee-table volumes, further emphasizing their distinct visual presence among other items.
