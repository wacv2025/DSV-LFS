A bottle is a cylindrical container typically distinguished by its narrow neck and wider body. The neck of a bottle is much narrower than its body, creating a distinct transition from the body to the opening. This neck often features a threaded or smooth lip designed to accommodate a cap or cork. The body of a bottle is usually more elongated and uniform in shape compared to other containers like jars or cans. Bottles can be made from various materials, including glass, plastic, and metal, each exhibiting different surface textures and transparencies. Glass bottles are often clear or tinted, allowing visibility of the contents, while plastic bottles may be opaque, translucent, or clear with visible seam lines from the molding process. Additionally, bottles often have a base that is slightly concave, providing stability and distinguishing them from similar objects such as flasks or tubes, which have flat or differently shaped bases. These features combined the narrow neck, wider body, material-specific textures, and concave base uniquely identify bottles among other similar object categories.
