A skateboard is distinguished by its specific visual features which include a narrow, elongated, and slightly curved wooden deck with a sandpaper-like grip tape on top for traction. The deck typically measures around 28 to 32 inches in length and 7.5 to 8.5 inches in width. The underside of the deck often displays vibrant graphics or designs. Attached to the deck are two metal trucks, each supporting a pair of small, hard polyurethane wheels, usually around 50 to 60mm in diameter. The wheels are mounted on axles, which are connected to the trucks, allowing for rotation and turning. The trucks include visible bushings and kingpins, which provide stability and maneuverability. The deck's edges are often rounded with a pronounced upward curve at the nose and tail, known as the kicktail, designed for performing tricks. These features, along with the skateboard's overall compact, portable form and distinctly urban aesthetic, set it apart from other similar objects like scooters or longboards, which have longer decks, larger wheels, and different handlebar structures.
