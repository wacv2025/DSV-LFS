Scissors are characterized by their distinct visual features that set them apart from other similar objects. Typically, scissors consist of two elongated, symmetrical metal blades that taper to sharp points at one end and are joined together at a central pivot point. This pivotal junction allows the blades to open and close in a scissoring motion. The handles of scissors are often made of plastic or metal and are designed to fit comfortably in the hand, facilitating control and precise cutting actions. The blades themselves are usually straight-edged with a slight curvature towards the tips, which aids in effective cutting. Unlike knives or razors, scissors feature a specific hinge mechanism that enables controlled cutting along a flat surface, distinguishing them by their unique operational and visual characteristics.
