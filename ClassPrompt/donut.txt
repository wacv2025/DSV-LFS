A donut is a round, torus-shaped object typically characterized by its golden-brown, fried exterior. It has a distinctive, symmetrical hole in the center, which makes it different from other pastry-like objects such as cakes or muffins. The surface is often smooth, though it can be glazed or coated with a thin layer of sugar, giving it a shiny or slightly crystalline appearance. Donuts can also feature a variety of toppings, such as colorful sprinkles, powdered sugar, or a drizzle of icing, each contributing to its unique visual appeal. The overall thickness of a donut is consistent, and the outer edge tends to be slightly puffier than the inner ring, highlighting the contrast between the two. This contrast in thickness and the presence of the central hole are key visual identifiers. Additionally, filled donuts, while still round, can have a more uniform surface without a central hole, often distinguished by a slight bulge or a small injection point where filling has been added. These distinguishing features, especially the central hole and the consistent torus shape, set donuts apart from other similar baked goods.
