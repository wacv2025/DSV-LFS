The bear is a large mammal distinguished by its robust, bulky body, short tail, and large paws with non-retractable claws. Its head is broad with a rounded appearance, and it features small, rounded ears set on the sides. The bear's snout is elongated and typically pronounced, giving it a distinctive profile. Bears have a thick coat of fur that varies in color from black, brown, and blonde to white, depending on the species. The fur is generally dense and shaggy, especially around the neck and shoulders, which can make these areas appear more pronounced. Their gait is plantigrade, meaning they walk on the soles of their feet, contributing to a distinctive, lumbering walk. Bears also have a significant size variation between species, but they are generally larger and more muscular compared to other similar mammals like canines or felines.
