A kite is distinguishable from other similar object categories by its unique combination of geometric shapes and structural features. Typically, it has a diamond or delta shape, characterized by a central spine running vertically and a horizontal cross spar, which together form a framework. The frame is covered with a brightly colored, often patterned fabric or lightweight plastic material, creating a taut surface. Kites usually have a long, narrow tail or multiple tails streaming from the bottom, which aids in stability and often includes decorative elements like ribbons or tassels. The kite is connected to a spool of string or line, allowing it to be flown at various heights and controlled from the ground. Additionally, kites often feature a bridle system of strings attached to the frame, which helps maintain its balance and flight angle. The overall design is aerodynamic, with sharp, defined edges and a lightweight construction to facilitate flight. The presence of these specific elements distinctive shape, frame structure, decorative tail, and control line sets kites apart visually from other flying objects like drones or balloons.
