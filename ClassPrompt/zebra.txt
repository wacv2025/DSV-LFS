The zebra is a distinct equid species characterized primarily by its unique coat pattern of black and white stripes, which are vertical on the body and horizontal on the legs. Each zebra has a unique stripe pattern, making it possible to identify individuals within a herd. Unlike horses and donkeys, zebras possess a mane that is short, upright, and striped, extending along the neck and sometimes partially down the back. Zebras have a stockier build compared to horses, with a barrel-shaped body, shorter legs, and a tail that ends in a tuft of hair. Their ears are large, rounded, and often exhibit a stripe pattern at the base. The face of a zebra typically features a prominent muzzle that is darker in color, with a more pronounced brow ridge compared to horses. Zebras' hooves are smaller and more rounded, adapted for their native savannah and grassland habitats. Additionally, zebras lack the long, flowing tail hair and manes found on many horse breeds, and their overall stature is generally shorter and more robust.
