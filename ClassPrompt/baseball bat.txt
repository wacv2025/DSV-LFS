A baseball bat is a long, cylindrical object primarily made of wood or metal, characterized by its smooth, unadorned surface. It tapers from a thicker barrel end to a thinner handle, which often features a grip made of tape or a textured material. The barrel, typically the heaviest and widest part, is designed for striking baseballs and has a slightly rounded, symmetrical shape. The handle is noticeably narrower, allowing for a firm grip, and usually culminates in a knob at the end to prevent the bat from slipping from the hands. The overall length of a baseball bat ranges from about 24 to 42 inches, with the diameter of the barrel not exceeding 2.75 inches. Unlike other similar objects, such as cricket bats or hockey sticks, the baseball bat lacks any flat surfaces or complex structures, maintaining a simple, streamlined silhouette. It is also devoid of any attached elements like blades or nets, distinguishing it from sports equipment used in other games. The smooth, polished appearance and the uniform cylindrical design, combined with the specific tapering from barrel to handle, are key visual features that set a baseball bat apart from other elongated sports equipment.
