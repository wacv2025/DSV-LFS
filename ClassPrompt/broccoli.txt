Broccoli is a green vegetable characterized by its distinct tree-like structure. The most distinguishing visual feature is its dense cluster of florets that form a rounded or slightly conical head, often referred to as a "crown." These florets are small, tightly packed, and display a fine, granular texture on the surface, which differentiates them from the more open, branching structures of cauliflower or the larger, less compact heads of cabbage. The florets are typically a deep green, sometimes with a slightly bluish or purplish tinge. Each floret is attached to a firm, fibrous stalk that can range from pale green to white, gradually thickening as it extends to the base. The stalks and stems are smooth and cylindrical, with a slightly ridged texture. Additionally, the overall shape of broccoli is more elongated and less rounded compared to cauliflower. The leaves surrounding the head are broad, dark green, and have a slightly wavy or serrated edge, contributing to its unique appearance. These features collectively distinguish broccoli from other similar vegetables.
