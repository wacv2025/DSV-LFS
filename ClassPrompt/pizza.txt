A pizza is typically a flat, round object characterized by a distinct crust that forms the outer edge. The crust is usually golden-brown, sometimes with a slightly charred appearance, and may have a varied thickness depending on the style (e.g., thin and crispy or thick and doughy). The surface of a pizza is generally covered in a layer of melted cheese, which often appears bubbly and browned in spots. Visible atop the cheese layer, there is an assortment of toppings, which can include pepperoni slices, which are circular and reddish-brown with curled edges; vegetables like green bell peppers, red onions, and black olives, which provide a variety of colors and shapes; and meats like sausage or ham, which appear as irregular chunks or slices. A pizza can also feature distinct sauces, such as tomato sauce, which gives a reddish hue peeking through the cheese and toppings. The overall presentation is a mix of colors and textures, with a clear, often symmetrical division of slices that reveal the pizza's round shape when viewed as a whole.
