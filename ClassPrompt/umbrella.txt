An umbrella is a handheld object characterized by a central rod, typically made of metal or durable plastic, which serves as the core support. At one end of the rod, there is a curved handle, often ergonomically designed for a comfortable grip. The other end of the rod features a collapsible, ribbed framework that fans out into a circular shape when opened. This framework is covered with a water-resistant fabric, usually nylon or polyester, which is taut when the umbrella is open. The fabric often features a variety of colors, patterns, or designs, making it easily recognizable. The ribbed framework typically consists of several metal or fiberglass ribs that provide structural integrity, with stretchers connecting the ribs to a runner that slides along the central rod to open or close the umbrella. The silhouette of an open umbrella is distinctively dome-like or slightly conical, creating a pronounced canopy. When closed, the umbrella's ribs and fabric collapse tightly around the central rod, making it compact and cylindrical. Some umbrellas may have additional features like a strap or sleeve for easy carrying, a button or latch mechanism for automatic opening and closing, or vents in the canopy for wind resistance. These unique combinations of a central rod, collapsible ribbed framework, water-resistant fabric canopy, and ergonomic handle distinguish umbrellas from other similar objects like parasols or walking sticks.
