The orange object class is characterized by its distinctive spherical to slightly oblong shape, with a dimpled, textured rind that ranges in color from bright orange to deep reddish-orange. The rind often has a slightly shiny, waxy appearance, sometimes with small, brownish blemishes or spots. The orange's surface is covered in tiny, evenly distributed pores, giving it a pebbled texture. Upon peeling, the inside reveals segments arranged in a radial pattern, each segment encapsulated in a thin, translucent membrane. The segments are filled with numerous tiny, teardrop-shaped juice vesicles that glisten and appear almost translucent, reflecting light. Oranges typically have a central white pithy core, and the peel, when removed, reveals a white, spongy pith that adheres to the segments. Unlike other citrus fruits, the color of an orange's flesh is a vibrant orange, enhancing its overall visual appeal and setting it apart from lemons, which are yellow, and grapefruits, which can range from pale yellow to pink or red. Additionally, oranges may have a slight indent at one end, often where the stem was attached, distinguishing them from the more uniform shapes of other fruits.
