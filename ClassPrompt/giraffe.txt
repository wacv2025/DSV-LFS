A giraffe is distinguished by its extraordinarily long neck and legs, which are unparalleled among land animals. Its neck, which can be up to six feet long, is relatively thin but strong, supporting a small, elongated head with large, expressive eyes, prominent ears, and often, two to five short, horn-like ossicones on top. The giraffe's body is covered in a distinctive pattern of irregular, polygonal patches that vary in color from tan to dark brown, separated by lighter, cream-colored lines. This unique coat pattern is highly individual, much like a human fingerprint. Giraffes also have a robust, rectangular torso that slopes downward from the shoulders to the hindquarters. Their tails are long and slender, ending in a tuft of dark hair. Additionally, giraffes have long, dark tongues that are prehensile, allowing them to grasp leaves from tall trees. Their gait is characterized by a unique, graceful walking motion where both legs on one side of the body move together. Overall, the giraffe's combination of height, neck and leg length, distinct coat pattern, and specific body shape makes it unmistakable compared to other animals.
