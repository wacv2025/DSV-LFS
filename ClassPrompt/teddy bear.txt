A teddy bear is characterized by its distinctive visual features that set it apart from other similar objects. Its most notable distinguishing trait is its compact, plush body, typically covered in soft fur or fabric, often in shades of brown, beige, or other muted colors. The head is proportionally large compared to the body, with small, round ears and large, expressive eyes usually made of plastic or glass. The face often features a friendly expression, with a small, stitched nose and mouth. Teddy bears commonly have short limbs, with rounded paws or feet, and their arms are designed to look embracing or welcoming. They lack complex articulation, with simple, sewn-on features that emphasize cuteness and innocence. The overall shape is usually symmetrical and chubby, conveying a sense of cuddliness and comfort. These visual characteristics collectively distinguish teddy bears from other similar objects like plush animals or dolls, emphasizing their iconic and universally recognized appearance.
