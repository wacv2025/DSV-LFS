A keyboard, in its distinctive visual form, is typified by its flat, elongated shape with an array of rectangular keys arranged in neat rows. Each key is typically square or slightly rectangular, often featuring rounded edges for ergonomic comfort during typing. The surface of the keys is uniformly smooth and matte or glossy, contrasting with the often darker or neutral-colored base. These keys are distinctly marked with alphanumeric characters, symbols, and functional indicators, often in contrasting colors such as white or light gray on dark backgrounds, aiding visibility and usability. Additionally, keyboards commonly include functional sections such as arrow keys, function keys (F1-F12), and a dedicated numerical keypad (on larger models), each section visually demarcated or slightly raised for tactile distinction. The overall profile of a keyboard is thin and flat, designed for ergonomic use on desks or tables, typically with a USB cable or wireless connectivity. These visual features collectively distinguish a keyboard from similar objects like calculators or remote controls, which lack the array of keys and alphanumeric layout essential for text input and control in computing environments.
