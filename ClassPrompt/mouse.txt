A mouse, in terms of its visual features distinguishing it from similar objects, typically appears as a small, hand-held device with a rounded or contoured shape that fits comfortably in the palm of the hand. It commonly features a prominent rounded top where two distinct clickable buttons are located, often accompanied by a scroll wheel positioned between them. This scroll wheel is a defining characteristic, often textured or ridged, facilitating vertical navigation through digital content. On its underside, a mouse typically has a smooth, flat surface for gliding across a desk or mouse pad, often accompanied by a sensor for tracking movement. The connection to a computer is usually via a visible cord or, in more modern versions, a wireless interface with a receiver. The overall size of a mouse is compact and ergonomic, designed for ease of use with minimal physical effort. These visual attributes collectively differentiate a mouse from similar devices like trackballs, which typically have a larger ball for movement control, or styluses, which lack buttons and have a different form factor designed for precise input on touchscreens.
