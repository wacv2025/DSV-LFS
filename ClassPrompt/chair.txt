Chairs are distinct from other similar objects due to several key visual features. Typically, a chair has a backrest that extends vertically from the seat, providing support for the back, which distinguishes it from stools or benches. The seat of a chair is usually flat and positioned at a height that allows for comfortable sitting, often supported by four legs, although variations with three or more legs or a central pedestal base exist. Armrests may be present, extending horizontally from the sides of the chair to support the arms, which is a feature not commonly found in stools. The overall form of a chair is generally compact and designed for individual use, unlike benches or sofas that accommodate multiple people. Additionally, chairs often have a structured and ergonomic design tailored to the human body, with curves and contours that enhance comfort, setting them apart from purely decorative seating options. Upholstery, padding, and material choices such as wood, metal, or plastic can vary, but the fundamental structural elements like the seat, backrest, legs, and sometimes armrests remain consistent, providing a clear visual identity that distinguishes chairs from other seating types.
