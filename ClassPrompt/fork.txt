A fork is a utensil characterized by its long handle and a head with multiple thin, pointed prongs, typically three or four, that extend outward in a straight line. These prongs are uniformly spaced and slightly tapered to sharp points, allowing for easy piercing and spearing of food. The transition from handle to prongs often features a slightly wider, flat base. Unlike spoons or knives, a fork's prongs create a distinct silhouette with negative space between them, making it immediately recognizable. The overall shape is elongated and symmetrical, with the prongs being the key distinguishing feature, as they are unique in number, length, and configuration compared to other utensils. Forks are usually made from metal, such as stainless steel, which gives them a reflective surface, though they can also be made from plastic or wood. Their design is practical and ergonomic, allowing for a comfortable grip and effective functionality.
