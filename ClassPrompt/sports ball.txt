A sports ball typically exhibits a distinct spherical shape, although variations like American footballs or rugby balls are more oval. Its surface is often textured or patterned to aid grip and aerodynamics; for example, a basketball has a pebbled, dimpled surface with visible grooves, whereas a soccer ball features a stitched or thermally bonded pattern of hexagons and pentagons. The coloration can vary widely but often includes contrasting colors or specific patterns that enhance visibility and identify the type of sport it is used for, such as the black and white panels of a soccer ball or the orange color of a basketball. Additionally, sports balls are often branded with logos, markings, or text indicating the manufacturer and sometimes the sport's governing body, setting them apart from other non-sport spherical objects. The size and weight can also vary significantly, but these are not visual features. The materials used can range from synthetic leather and rubber to more advanced composites, with the seams, if present, being either stitched or glued. This combination of shape, surface texture, patterns, colors, and branding distinguishes sports balls from other similar object categories.
