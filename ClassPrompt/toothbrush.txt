A toothbrush is visually distinguished by several key features that set it apart from other similar objects. Firstly, its elongated handle, typically slender and cylindrical, often features ergonomic contours or grips designed for comfortable hand placement and control during use. Attached to this handle is a distinctive brush head, characterized by densely packed bristles of varying lengths, arranged in rows. These bristles are usually made from plastic or nylon, and are designed to effectively clean teeth and gums. The brush head itself is compact and typically rectangular or oval in shape, contrasting with the broader, flatter heads of other hygiene tools like hairbrushes or combs. The color palette of toothbrushes varies widely, often featuring bright hues such as blue, green, pink, or white, with occasional patterns or designs for aesthetic appeal. Overall, the combination of a slender handle, compact brush head with densely packed bristles, and vibrant color schemes are distinctive visual markers that define the toothbrush as a unique object within the realm of personal hygiene tools.
