A car object class is visually distinguishable by several specific features. Cars typically have a well-defined, enclosed cabin structure with windows made of transparent glass or similar material, providing visibility all around. The body shape varies but generally includes a hood at the front, a trunk at the back, and a passenger compartment in between. Most cars have four wheels, each housed within a wheel well, and often feature hubcaps or alloy wheels with distinct patterns. The front end is characterized by a grille, which may be a mesh or slatted design, and a pair of headlights, usually symmetrically placed on either side of the grille, emitting white or yellow light. Additionally, cars have rear lights that include brake lights and turn signals, emitting red and amber lights respectively. Side mirrors are present on both sides of the vehicle, mounted on the front doors, while door handles are typically located at the midsection of the door panels. The presence of a license plate, usually positioned at the front and rear ends, further distinguishes cars. The overall silhouette of a car is elongated and streamlined, often with an aerodynamic profile that includes a sloping windshield, roofline, and rear window, differentiating it from boxier or taller vehicle types like trucks or buses.A car, as an object class, is distinguished by its specific visual features which set it apart from other similar categories. A typical car has a low, elongated body with a streamlined shape designed for aerodynamics, including a sloping windshield and often a sloping rear window. It features four wheels, generally exposed or partially covered by wheel wells, with the front pair being steerable. The front of a car prominently displays a grille, often flanked by headlights on either side, which can vary in shape but are typically forward-facing and housed within distinct enclosures. The rear of the car usually has tail lights, which are red and positioned at the outer edges of the back end, alongside a trunk or hatchback. The sides of a car have doors, usually two or four, with windows that may be either framed or frameless, and often include rearview mirrors mounted near the front. The roofline of a car is typically continuous and smooth, differing in height and shape between sedans, coupes, hatchbacks, and convertibles. Cars also feature various trim elements and badges that can be unique to a manufacturer or model, adding to their distinct visual identity.
