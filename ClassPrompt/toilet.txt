A toilet is a distinct bathroom fixture characterized by several unique visual features. It typically has a bowl-shaped seat made of porcelain or ceramic, with a rounded or oval opening that slopes inward. The bowl is often connected to a pedestal or base, which is relatively narrow compared to the bowl itself, giving it a recognizable silhouette. Attached to the back of the bowl is a water tank, which is usually rectangular and taller than it is wide, designed to hold flushing water. The toilet seat, often made of plastic, is hinged at the rear and can be lifted or lowered. This seat usually has a lid that matches in material and design. The bowl's interior is smooth and glazed, facilitating easy cleaning and often features a water-filled trap at the bottom, visible when the lid and seat are raised. The flush handle or button is typically located on the side or top of the water tank, which distinguishes it from other fixtures like bidets or urinals that lack such a tank. Overall, the combination of the bowl's shape, the attached water tank, the hinged seat and lid, and the flush mechanism make the toilet visually distinct from similar bathroom objects.
