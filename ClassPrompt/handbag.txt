Handbags are distinguished by several visual features that set them apart from other similar object categories. Typically, a handbag has a structured or semi-structured form, often rectangular or trapezoidal, with a variety of sizes ranging from small clutches to larger tote bags. One key distinguishing feature is the presence of handles or straps, which can be short for handheld use, longer for shoulder carrying, or even adjustable for crossbody wear. The materials used in handbags are usually high-quality and visually distinctive, such as leather, faux leather, canvas, or fabric, often with a smooth, textured, or patterned finish. Many handbags feature metal hardware elements, including zippers, buckles, clasps, and decorative studs, which add to their aesthetic and functional appeal. Additionally, handbags often have exterior pockets or compartments, and sometimes decorative elements like brand logos, tassels, or charms. The interior of a handbag is typically organized with multiple compartments, pockets, and sometimes a lining with a contrasting or branded pattern. These features collectively give handbags a polished, sophisticated appearance that differentiates them from other bag types like backpacks, which are generally more utilitarian, or briefcases, which have a more professional and rigid structure.
