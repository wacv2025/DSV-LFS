Elephants are distinguished by their large, grey, wrinkled skin and massive size, making them one of the most recognizable land animals. Their most prominent feature is the long, muscular trunk, which is an extension of the upper lip and nose, used for breathing, grasping objects, and producing sound. Elephants have large, fan-shaped ears that are significantly larger than those of other animals, aiding in temperature regulation and communication. They possess thick, pillar-like legs and broad, round feet with distinct toenails. Their tusks, which are elongated incisor teeth, are another defining characteristic, growing outwards and used for digging, lifting, and defense. The eyes of elephants are relatively small compared to their head size, with noticeable eyelashes. Their tails are long with a tuft of coarse hair at the end. Overall, their massive, robust body, combined with unique features like the trunk, tusks, and large ears, sets them apart from other large mammals.
