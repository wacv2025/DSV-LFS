A sandwich typically consists of two slices of bread or a single split roll, with various fillings placed between them. The bread can be of different types, such as white, whole wheat, rye, or a baguette, and it often has a crusty exterior with a soft, porous interior. The distinguishing feature of a sandwich is the layered arrangement, where fillings such as meats, cheeses, vegetables, and condiments are visibly placed between the bread slices. The fillings can create a contrast in textures and colors, such as the pink of ham, the yellow of cheese, the green of lettuce, and the red of tomatoes. The sandwich is usually rectangular or oval-shaped, depending on the type of bread used, and it often has a hand-held, compact form. The edges of the sandwich are generally neat, although some fillings may slightly protrude or peek out from the sides, adding to the visual appeal. A distinguishing feature is the cross-sectional view when cut in half, revealing the distinct, organized layers of ingredients. This clear demarcation of layers, along with the variety in colors and textures of the fillings, sets a sandwich apart from other food categories.
