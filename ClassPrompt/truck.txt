A truck, as an object class, can be visually distinguished from other similar categories by its robust and often boxy structure, typically featuring a large, enclosed cargo area or an open bed at the rear. Unlike smaller vehicles, trucks possess a prominent and elevated cab section with a clear separation from the cargo area, often showcasing a distinctive front grille, large side mirrors, and elevated, wide-set headlights. The tires of trucks are significantly larger and thicker, providing a noticeable ground clearance. Additionally, trucks commonly have dual rear wheels (known as "dually") to support heavier loads. The body may exhibit multiple axles, especially in larger models, enhancing its length and capacity. Trucks often display utility elements such as toolboxes, ladders, and towing hitches, distinguishing them further from passenger cars. The presence of roof-mounted clearance lights is also a typical feature in many truck models, adding to their distinctive silhouette.A truck is distinguished from other similar object categories by its large, robust frame and size, which typically exceeds that of cars and vans. Its front section features a distinct, often vertical grille, flanked by sizable, square or rectangular headlights. The trucks cab, which may be a single or double cabin, is usually positioned high off the ground with a pronounced step for entry, highlighting its elevated stance. Unlike cars, the trucks rear is characterized by an open or enclosed cargo area, either a flatbed or a box-like structure, designed for hauling goods. The presence of multiple axles, typically with large, heavy-duty tires, further sets trucks apart, providing the necessary support for carrying heavy loads. Additionally, trucks often have prominent side mirrors extending outwards to provide better visibility around their large bodies. These vehicles may also have conspicuous tailgates and often feature rear bumpers designed for utility and durability. The overall silhouette of a truck is notably bulkier and more angular compared to other vehicles, emphasizing its function over form.
