A knife is a tool typically characterized by a long, narrow blade with a sharp edge and a pointed tip, used primarily for cutting. The blade is usually made of metal, often stainless steel, and can have a smooth or serrated edge. One of the key visual features distinguishing a knife from similar objects is the presence of a defined handle, which can be made from various materials such as wood, plastic, or metal. The handle is ergonomically designed to fit comfortably in the hand and often features a guard to prevent the hand from slipping onto the blade. The blade itself is straight or slightly curved and lacks the broad, flat surface area seen in tools like cleavers or the multiple, symmetrical tines found on forks. Additionally, the transition from the blade to the handle, known as the bolster, is typically prominent in knives, providing structural integrity and balance. Knives may also have unique visual markings such as brand logos, measurements, or decorative elements, but their defining feature remains the sharp, singular blade designed explicitly for cutting tasks.
