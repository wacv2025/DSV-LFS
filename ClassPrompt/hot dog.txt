A hot dog is typically an elongated, cylindrical food item, encased in a bun, and distinguished by its smooth, glossy surface which can range in color from light tan to deep brown, often with grill marks running perpendicular to its length. The sausage itself is usually uniform in diameter, slightly curved, and tapers slightly at both ends. The bun that encases the hot dog is a soft, slightly elongated roll with a split along the top where the sausage is nestled. This bun is often golden brown, with a lightly toasted or slightly shiny appearance from butter or egg wash. Additional visual identifiers include common toppings like a zigzag of bright yellow mustard, a squiggle of red ketchup, and relish or onions that add texture and color contrast. Unlike other similar foods, a hot dog typically does not have the textured, chunky fillings of a sandwich, nor the layered appearance of a burger; instead, its clean, streamlined look with a focus on the singular sausage and smooth bun sets it apart visually.
