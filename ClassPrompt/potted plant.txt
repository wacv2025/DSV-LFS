A potted plant, distinguishable from other similar object categories, primarily features a container or pot that houses the plant. The pot can vary in material, commonly ceramic, plastic, or clay and often has a rounded, cylindrical, or occasionally squared shape. The pot typically contains visible soil or growing medium from which the plant emerges. The plant itself is characterized by its foliage, which may include a variety of leaves, stems, and sometimes flowers. The leaves can be broad or narrow, flat or textured, and are often vibrant green but can also display other colors, variegation, or patterns depending on the plant species. The stems are usually slender and may have nodes or joints where leaves or branches emerge. Potted plants often show an organic and asymmetrical form as opposed to artificial symmetry seen in many decorative items. Unlike bouquets or artificial plants, potted plants exhibit natural growth patterns, sometimes with visible new growth or dead leaves, enhancing their living, dynamic appearance. Additionally, the presence of water stains, mineral deposits, or dirt on the pot can further emphasize its authentic, natural state.
