A surfboard is characterized by its elongated, streamlined shape, typically measuring between 6 to 12 feet in length, with a smooth, hydrodynamic profile. It has a slightly curved, tapered nose at the front and a wider, flat tail at the back. The boards deck, where the surfer stands, is flat or gently contoured, often featuring a textured surface or grip pads to prevent slipping. The underside, or bottom, of the surfboard is flat or concave to enhance water flow and stability. Surfboards usually have one to four removable fins attached to the tail, which help with maneuverability and control. The edges, or rails, of the surfboard are rounded or sharp, influencing the boards performance in different wave conditions. Surfboards come in various vibrant colors and designs, often featuring brand logos or custom artwork, but their sleek, glossy finish is a consistent visual feature.
