A parking meter is characterized by a tall, slim, and cylindrical or rectangular post often made of metal, typically standing at an average human's waist to chest height. The most distinguishing feature is the head, which houses the operational components. The head is usually broader than the post and may be circular or rectangular. It includes a display window made of glass or plastic, which shows digital or mechanical readings, often indicating time remaining or fee information. Directly below or next to this display, there are one or more slots for coins, cards, or digital payments. Buttons or knobs are commonly present for setting time or initiating transactions, often marked with numbers or symbols. Some modern parking meters feature an electronic screen with touch capabilities, and solar panels on top. The head often has distinct coloring, such as bright red, yellow, or blue, which makes it stand out, and it may have labels or instructions printed on it. The base is usually bolted to the ground and may have a broader flange for stability. These visual elements collectively make the parking meter distinct from other public utility objects such as mailboxes, which are bulkier and lack operational components like a display window, or parking signs, which are flat and purely informational without transactional features.
