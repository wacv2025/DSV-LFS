A bench is typically a long, horizontal seat designed for multiple people to sit on, characterized by its distinct structure comprising a flat, elongated surface often made of wood, metal, or composite materials. What sets a bench apart visually from similar objects like chairs or stools is its extended, uninterrupted seating area, which lacks individual divisions for separate seating. Benches often feature supportive legs or a continuous base along their length for stability, and may have armrests at each end, though these are sometimes absent. The backrest, when present, usually runs the entire length of the seat, providing uniform support, unlike the segmented backrests found on chairs. Some benches also incorporate decorative elements like slats, ornate metalwork, or curved armrests, contributing to their distinct appearance. Additionally, benches are commonly found in public spaces such as parks and streets, often having a utilitarian design suited for outdoor use, which may include weather-resistant finishes and materials.
