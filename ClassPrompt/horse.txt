A horse is distinguished by its large, muscular body with a distinctively elongated, arched neck. Its head is proportionately long with a straight or slightly convex profile, large expressive eyes, and mobile, pointed ears. The mane, a defining feature, runs along the top of the neck and can vary in length and texture. Horses also have a distinctively long, flowing tail. Their legs are strong and slender with pronounced joints, ending in solid, rounded hooves. The overall body structure is streamlined and built for speed and endurance, unlike other similar animals like donkeys or mules which have a stockier build and shorter legs. The coat of a horse is smooth and can come in a variety of colors and patterns, often featuring unique markings such as blazes, stars, or socks that are distinctively characteristic to individual horses.
