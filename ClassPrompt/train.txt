A train object class is distinguished by its elongated, segmented body structure comprising multiple connected carriages or cars. Each carriage is typically rectangular and streamlined to minimize air resistance, featuring a consistent and linear alignment along a central axis. The carriages rest on metal wheels that are often visible and connected by couplings, running on parallel steel tracks. The front of the train, known as the locomotive, usually has a distinctive, often larger and more complex design compared to the rest of the train, with a cab window, headlights, and sometimes a prominent cowcatcher or pilot. Trains often have visible doors and windows along the sides of the carriages, arranged in a regular, repeating pattern. The overall design is characterized by a sense of linearity and modularity, with each segment resembling the others but distinguished by the uniform connection throughout. The presence of pantographs or other overhead electrical connections may also be visible on electric trains, adding to their distinctiveness. Additionally, trains often display livery or logos specific to railway companies, which can provide visual identifiers separate from the structural features.A train, as a distinct visual object class, is characterized by several unique features that set it apart from other similar categories. Trains are long, multi-carriage vehicles that run on railway tracks, which are typically made of steel rails. Each carriage or wagon is connected in a linear sequence, and the entire structure is often elevated above the ground level. The body of a train is typically elongated and cylindrical, with a uniform width throughout its length, though the front part, the locomotive, often has a more streamlined, aerodynamic shape. The exterior surface is commonly painted with distinct color schemes and markings, such as logos or symbols of the operating company, and might feature large windows along the passenger carriages. Trains are mounted on a series of large, metal wheels that fit snugly onto the rails, and these wheels are usually arranged in pairs or sets attached to bogies. Unlike other vehicles, trains have a noticeable lack of traditional tires and steering mechanisms. Additionally, the infrastructure around trains, such as railway stations, overhead electric lines, or diesel exhaust systems, further visually supports the identification of trains. This combination of long, uniform structure, rail-specific wheels, and contextual rail infrastructure distinctly marks trains from other vehicular categories.
