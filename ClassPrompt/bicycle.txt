A bicycle is a human-powered, pedal-driven vehicle characterized by its two wheels aligned in a straight line. Key distinguishing visual features include the presence of a diamond-shaped frame composed of two triangles: the main frame triangle and the rear triangle. This frame connects the two wheels via a fork for the front wheel and chainstays and seatstays for the rear wheel. The front wheel is attached to a rotating fork steered by handlebars, which typically extend horizontally. The rear wheel is connected to a drivetrain system, which includes pedals, cranks, a chain, and one or more gears or cogs. Bicycles also have a saddle (seat) mounted on the seat post, usually located within the upper part of the rear triangle. The wheels are of equal size, with spokes radiating from a central hub to the rim. The tires are generally narrow and may have smooth or treaded surfaces. Additional distinguishing features include brake mechanisms (rim brakes, disc brakes, or drum brakes) and, in some models, additional attachments like reflectors, lights, and fenders. Bicycles do not have the enclosed bodies, engines, or complex suspension systems seen in motorcycles or scooters, further distinguishing their simple, lightweight construction.A bicycle is a human-powered, pedal-driven vehicle characterized by its two wheels of equal size mounted in line on a rigid frame. The frame of a bicycle typically has a triangular structure with a top tube connecting the seat post to the head tube, a down tube running from the head tube to the bottom bracket, and a seat tube joining the seat post and bottom bracket. The wheels are spoked and usually feature thin, high-pressure tires. Distinguishing features include handlebars for steering, which are generally straight or slightly curved, and a saddle for seating, mounted on an adjustable seat post. Bicycles have a chain-driven transmission system, with a chain running between the pedals and the rear wheel, often featuring multiple gears visible on the rear wheel's cassette and the front crankset. Brakes are mounted on the wheels, commonly as caliper brakes clamping onto the rim or disc brakes attached to the wheel hub. Unlike motorcycles, bicycles lack an engine and have a more delicate, streamlined appearance. The pedals, where the rider's feet rest, are distinct with their rotating mechanism around the bottom bracket. The bicycle's frame and components are typically lightweight and designed for efficiency and speed, contrasting with the bulkier, more robust build of motorcycles and other similar vehicles.
