Cows possess several distinguishing visual features that set them apart from similar object categories. They have a large, robust body with a pronounced rectangular shape, supported by four sturdy legs ending in cloven hooves. Their heads are relatively large, with broad, flat foreheads and distinctive long, broad snouts. A cow's eyes are large and round, usually positioned on the sides of their head, giving them a wide field of vision. They have large, prominent ears that can be either upright or slightly drooping. One of the most notable features is their pair of horns, which can vary in size and shape but are typically curved and symmetrical, though some cows may be naturally polled (hornless). Their tails are long and thin, ending in a tuft of hair, used to swat away insects. The skin of cows is covered in short hair, with color patterns that can vary significantly, including solid colors, spots, and patches in hues of black, white, brown, or a combination thereof. Unlike other similar animals, cows have a prominent udder with visible teats, particularly in dairy breeds, which is a key distinguishing feature. Additionally, cows have a distinctive gait and posture, often appearing more slow-moving and deliberate compared to other livestock. Their overall demeanor and physical build, including the musculature and the shape of their neck and back, contribute to their unique visual identification.
