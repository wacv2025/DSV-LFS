Sheep are characterized by their medium-sized, robust bodies covered in dense, often curly wool, which can vary in color from white to brown or black, distinguishing them from other similar animals like goats. Their woolly coats are a standout feature, especially when compared to the typically smoother fur of goats. Sheep have a distinctive face structure, with a somewhat elongated, slightly curved nose and a gentle expression. Their ears are generally short and pointed, extending outwards or slightly upwards. Unlike goats, sheep lack a beard, and their tails are shorter and often downward-hanging, whereas goats have longer, upright tails. Sheep also have cloven hooves similar to goats, but their hooves are usually less pronounced. Another distinguishing feature is their horn structure; while some sheep breeds are hornless (polled), those with horns have them curling in a circular pattern, unlike the backward-curving horns of goats. Additionally, sheep's eyes have horizontal slit-shaped pupils, which can give them a calmer, more serene appearance compared to the typically more alert expression of goats. These features collectively distinguish sheep from other similar livestock.
