Apples are distinguishable from other similar fruit categories by their smooth, often shiny skin that can vary in color, most commonly appearing in shades of red, green, or yellow, sometimes with a combination of these colors in a mottled or striped pattern. They have a distinct round to slightly oval shape, typically with a noticeable depression at the top where the stem is attached. The stem is usually short and sturdy, protruding from the top center. Apples often have a uniform texture, though some varieties may exhibit slight ribbing or dimples. Their size can range from small to medium, generally fitting comfortably in the palm of an adult hand. The skin of an apple can be either uniformly colored or exhibit gradients and speckles, providing a visually varied surface. The flesh, visible if the apple is cut or bitten into, is usually white to cream-colored, firm, and crisp, contrasting sharply with the outer skin. These visual features collectively help in identifying apples and distinguishing them from other fruits like pears, which are more elongated, or plums, which are smaller and have a more uniform, deeper skin color.
