The sheep object class is visually distinct from other similar animal categories due to its unique combination of features. Sheep typically have a robust, stocky body covered in thick, curly wool or fleece, which can vary in color but is commonly white, cream, or light brown. Their heads are relatively small compared to their bodies and are adorned with prominent, curved horns in males (rams), while females (ewes) may have smaller or no horns at all. Sheep's faces are broad with a short, flat snout, and they often have large, expressive eyes set on the sides of their heads, giving them a wide field of vision. Their ears are medium-sized and typically stick out sideways, distinguishing them from the more erect ears of goats. Additionally, sheep have a distinctive gait with a lumbering, steady movement that contrasts with the more agile, bounding motion of deer or the quicker, more erratic movement of rabbits. The combination of woolly texture, distinctive head shape, and unique gait makes sheep visually identifiable and sets them apart from other similar animals.
