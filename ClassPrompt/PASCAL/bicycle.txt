A bicycle is distinguished by its specific visual features which include a frame with a diamond-shaped or step-through design, usually composed of two triangles. It has two wheels of equal size aligned along a single axis, with spokes connecting the rim to the hub. The front wheel is attached to a rotating fork, which extends upward to a handlebar, typically flat or slightly curved. The handlebar is connected to the frame via a stem and can feature grips or bar tape for hand placement. A saddle, positioned above the rear wheel, provides a seat for the rider and is attached to the frame by a seat post. Pedals are attached to cranks that are connected by a bottom bracket to the frame's lower area, forming the drivetrain. A chain runs from the front chainring, located near the pedals, to the rear sprockets on the rear wheel's hub, often covered by a derailleur for gear shifting. Additionally, bicycles may have brakes, typically rim or disc types, which are mounted on the frame or fork and connect to levers on the handlebars via cables. Reflectors or lights are often attached to the frame, wheels, or handlebars for visibility, and sometimes, a bicycle will feature a basket or panniers for carrying items. These elements together create a distinct silhouette and functional structure that sets bicycles apart from similar wheeled objects such as motorcycles, scooters, or wheelchairs.
