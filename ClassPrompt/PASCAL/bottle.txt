Bottles are characterized by their distinct cylindrical shape, typically tapering slightly from a wider base to a narrower neck. This neck often features a threaded or smooth finish designed to accommodate a cap or stopper. The body of the bottle is usually elongated and can be transparent, translucent, or opaque, made from materials such as glass, plastic, or metal. Unlike jars or cans, bottles have a continuous curve from the body to the neck, often with a shoulder where the body meets the neck. The base is usually flat, allowing the bottle to stand upright. Bottles may have labels or embossments that provide texture and visual information, distinguishing them from other containers like jars or cans. The presence of a neck and a cap or stopper, combined with a generally taller and slimmer profile, are key visual features that set bottles apart from other similar object categories.
