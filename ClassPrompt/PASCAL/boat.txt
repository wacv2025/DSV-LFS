The boat object class is distinguished by several unique visual features. Firstly, the hull, which is the main body of the boat, has a distinct elongated and curved shape, often narrowing towards the bow (front) and widening at the stern (rear). This curvature provides a hydrodynamic form, aiding in movement through water. Boats also have a visible keel along the bottom, extending downward, which is not present in other similar objects. The deck, situated atop the hull, is typically flat and can feature railings or guardrails. Above the deck, many boats have superstructures, such as cabins or pilot houses, often with windows or portholes. Boats are equipped with visible propulsion mechanisms, like outboard or inboard motors, or sail masts and rigging for sailboats, which include sails, lines, and booms. The presence of a rudder at the stern, sometimes accompanied by a propeller, is another distinctive feature. Unlike other vehicles, boats may display navigation lights and equipment such as anchors, ropes, and buoys. The combination of these features curved hull, keel, deck, superstructures, propulsion systems, and nautical equipment visually differentiates boats from other object categories like cars, buses, or planes.
