A chair is distinguished by several visual features that set it apart from other similar object categories. Most notably, a chair typically has a flat, horizontal surface for seating, which is elevated off the ground by legs. These legs can vary in number but commonly total four, providing stability. The backrest is another distinctive feature, which is a vertical support extending upwards from the rear edge of the seat, often contoured for comfort. Armrests may also be present on either side, attached to both the backrest and seat, though not all chairs have them. Chairs often exhibit a structured, ergonomic design, with the seat and backrest sometimes padded and covered in fabric or leather. In contrast to stools or benches, which may lack a backrest or arms, the presence of these elements in chairs provides clear differentiation. The materials used in chairs can range from wood and metal to plastic, with various finishes and textures, adding to their unique appearance. The legs of chairs can also be straight, angled, or feature cross-bracing, further distinguishing them from other seating options like sofas or ottomans, which often have a more cushioned and less defined structure.
