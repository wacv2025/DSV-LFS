The cat object class can be visually distinguished by several key features. Cats typically have a sleek and flexible body covered in fur that varies in color and pattern, including solid, tabby, tortoiseshell, and calico. Their heads are generally rounded with prominent, triangular ears that are set wide apart and capable of independent movement. Cats possess large, almond-shaped eyes that can vary in color from green to yellow, blue, and copper, often with a reflective layer called the tapetum lucidum that gives them a distinctive glow in low light. Their noses are small and often pink, black, or a combination of colors, with prominent whisker pads from which long, sensitive whiskers extend. Unlike dogs, their paws are rounded with retractable claws, which are typically sharp and curved. Cats also have a distinctive tail that can be long and tapered, carried high, and expressive, often used to communicate their mood. Their overall musculature is lean and agile, allowing for graceful and precise movements. Additionally, the facial expressions of cats are unique, often characterized by a calm or slightly aloof demeanor, with subtle changes in ear and eye positioning indicating their mood or intentions. These combined features make cats visually distinct from other similar object categories.
