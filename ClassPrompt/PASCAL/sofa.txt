The sofa object class is visually distinguished from other similar categories by its unique combination of broad, cushioned surfaces and distinct structural elements. Typically, a sofa has a wide, horizontally elongated shape designed for seating multiple people, characterized by its substantial, upholstered cushions that are often soft and plush. The backrest and armrests are integral parts of the sofa, providing a continuous and padded surface that distinguishes it from chairs or benches, which may have less cushioning and more segmented or rigid forms. The sofa's frame is usually hidden or subtly integrated into the design, giving it a seamless appearance with uniform upholstery that contrasts with the more visible structural elements of similar items like armchairs or recliners. The sofa's legs, if present, are often shorter and less prominent compared to those of chairs, contributing to its low, grounded look. Additionally, sofas often feature a more complex and varied set of textile patterns and colors, with upholstery materials like leather, fabric, or microfiber that add to their distinct visual identity compared to simpler, more utilitarian seating options.
