Horses are distinguished by several key visual features that set them apart from other similar object categories. They typically have a large, muscular body with a well-defined, elongated neck that supports a large, expressive head. Their legs are long and slender, ending in distinct, solid hooves, which are quite different from the cloven hooves of deer or the rounded paws of other quadrupeds. Horses possess a unique, flowing mane that runs along the top of their neck, and their tail is often long and bushy, frequently used for swatting insects. Their coat can come in various colors and patterns, including solid, spotted, and patched, with common colors such as bay, black, chestnut, and gray. Their large, expressive eyes are located on the sides of their head, giving them a wide field of vision, and their ears are mobile, able to swivel independently to detect sounds from different directions. In addition, their muzzle is broad and often covered in short, fine hair, and their overall build is elegant yet powerful, characterized by a well-defined withers and a prominent shoulder.
