A car object class can be visually distinguished from other similar object categories by several key features. The overall shape is characterized by a relatively low and elongated body, typically with a distinct hood at the front and a trunk or hatchback at the rear. Cars have a roof supported by pillars that form a closed cabin for passengers, with windows on the sides and usually a larger windshield and rear window. They are equipped with four wheels, each housed in distinct wheel arches. The wheels themselves are generally covered by hubcaps or rims and are spaced further apart than in most other vehicles, such as motorcycles or bicycles. Additionally, cars have side mirrors protruding from the front doors or the front part of the cabin, and they often feature distinctive front and rear light clusters, including headlights, taillights, and sometimes fog lights. The presence of doors, typically two or four, along with handles, is another notable feature. Many cars also display a grille at the front, which can vary significantly in design but usually serves as a noticeable element distinguishing the vehicle's front end. The presence of a license plate on the front and rear of the vehicle is another distinctive feature. Overall, the combination of these elements a low, enclosed body, four wheels, distinct lighting, and mirrors visually separates the car object class from other vehicle categories like motorcycles, bicycles, or trucks.
