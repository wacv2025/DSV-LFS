The "person" object class is visually distinguished from other similar object categories by several key features. Primarily, it is characterized by an upright, bipedal posture, with the body divided into a head, torso, and limbs. The head is typically round or oval-shaped, with facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth that are usually distinct and centrally located. The torso is often elongated and slightly narrower at the waist, with arms and legs extending from it. Human limbs are generally proportional and exhibit a range of motion that is unique to people, including the ability to flex and rotate at joints like elbows and knees. Additionally, the skin tone and texture can vary widely, but humans often exhibit a range of clothing and accessories that contribute to their visual identification. In contrast to animals or other objects, the overall shape and structure of a person are relatively consistent, with specific features like hands, feet, and facial expressions that are immediately recognizable. The visual cues of clothing, posture, and specific anatomical features like a human face and bipedal stance are critical in differentiating the "person" class from other categories.
