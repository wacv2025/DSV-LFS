An aeroplane, distinct from other similar object categories, possesses several key visual features. The most prominent is its streamlined fuselage, often cylindrical and tapered towards the nose and tail, designed for aerodynamic efficiency. Fixed wings, typically two, extend horizontally from either side of the fuselage and are crucial for flight. These wings often have a noticeable dihedral angle, tilting upwards slightly from the body. The tail section includes vertical and horizontal stabilizers, forming a T or cross shape. Additionally, aeroplanes have a series of small, circular windows along the fuselage for passenger and crew visibility. The landing gear, which may be retracted during flight, includes multiple wheels and is positioned under the wings or fuselage. Jet engines, usually cylindrical, are either mounted under the wings or attached to the rear of the fuselage, distinguished by their large, round intakes and exhausts. The presence of these specific features in combination the streamlined fuselage, fixed wings, tail stabilizers, landing gear, windows, and jet engines distinctly characterizes an aeroplane, setting it apart visually from other objects such as helicopters, cars, or boats.
