A bus is characterized by its large, elongated rectangular body, which typically spans multiple passenger windows on each side, often numbering between eight and twelve. The bus's height is substantial, usually more than that of a standard truck, and it features a prominent, wide front windshield divided into two or more sections. Its wheels, larger than those on regular cars, are positioned closer to the front and rear ends of the vehicle, creating a long wheelbase that is a key distinguishing feature. The front of the bus often has a flat or slightly curved design, with large side mirrors extending outward to enhance driver visibility. The rear of the bus usually includes large, vertical tail lights, which are significantly higher than those found on smaller vehicles. Buses also often feature multiple doors, including a primary entrance at the front and an additional one midway or at the rear, designed for passenger boarding and alighting. Furthermore, buses may have route display panels above the windshield or on the sides, and sometimes roof-mounted equipment, such as air conditioning units, that add to their distinctive silhouette. These features collectively help in differentiating buses from other large vehicles like trucks and vans.
