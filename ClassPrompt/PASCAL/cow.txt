The cow is characterized by its distinctive visual features that set it apart from similar objects like horses or bison. It typically has a robust and rounded body with a broad, rectangular shape, supported by four sturdy legs. The cows coat can vary in color, but it is often found in patterns such as solid white, black, brown, or a combination of these with specific markings like spots or patches. One of the most prominent features is its large, expressive eyes positioned on either side of its head, along with a relatively wide and flat face. Cows have a pair of curved, horn-like structures on their heads, though in some breeds these may be absent or reduced. Their ears are typically large and rounded, and they have a distinctive, long, and slender tail with a tuft of hair at the end. Additionally, cows have a noticeable udder in females, located underneath their abdomen, which is absent in males. This udder is a key visual feature distinguishing cows from other similar animals like bulls, which do not possess it.
