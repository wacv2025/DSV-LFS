The train object class is distinguished visually by several prominent features. Trains are characterized by their elongated, rectangular shape, with a series of connected, uniform, or slightly varying segments forming a continuous line. They typically have a streamlined front, often with a pointed or rounded nose, and a long, flat top surface. The sides of a train are usually adorned with multiple, evenly spaced windows and doors that often appear as a repetitive pattern. Trains often display a distinct, segmented appearance with visible joints or connections between individual cars, and they may have prominent, large, and sometimes cylindrical wheels underneath. The color scheme of trains can vary widely, but they often feature bold, contrasting stripes or patterns that run the length of the vehicle, contributing to their identifiable appearance. Additionally, trains are usually accompanied by elements like track wheels, which are visible from the side, and they often have large, visible headlights and a more pronounced front end compared to other vehicles. These visual characteristics, including their length, segmented design, repetitive window patterns, and track wheels, help distinguish trains from other similar object categories like buses or trucks.
