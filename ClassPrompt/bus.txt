A bus is a large, boxy vehicle characterized by its considerable length and height compared to typical passenger cars. Its most distinguishing visual features include multiple rows of large windows running along both sides, often extending from just below the roofline to above the midpoint of the vehicle's height. These windows are typically rectangular and uniformly sized. The front of the bus usually has a large, expansive windshield that can be either flat or slightly curved, often divided into two sections. Above the windshield, there is commonly a destination sign display. Buses also have prominent side mirrors mounted on extended arms for wide-angle visibility. The doors, located on one or both sides, are usually large and glass-panelled, designed to accommodate multiple passengers at once; they can be either swing-out or sliding doors. The exterior often features a prominent livery or color scheme unique to the bus company or transit authority. The rear of the bus is often flat or slightly rounded, with large, vertically aligned taillights. Additionally, buses typically have multiple sets of wheels, including a pair of large rear wheels to support the weight, and sometimes feature a higher roofline compared to other vehicles, often with air-conditioning units mounted on top. These features collectively distinguish a bus from other similar object categories such as trucks or large vans.A bus is characterized by its large, elongated rectangular shape, typically much longer and taller than a car. The body is often boxy with a flat or slightly rounded front. It features a high roofline and extensive window space along both sides, with multiple large windows that are usually uniformly spaced, often with a horizontal dividing line separating upper and lower window sections. Buses typically have two doors: a wide front door near the driver's seat and a second door located midway or at the rear, both often glass-paned. The front of the bus has a prominent windshield that is wide and tall, sometimes split into two sections. Buses usually have large side mirrors extending from both sides of the front. The rear often has a wide window, and the back design is generally simple and functional. Additionally, buses have a higher ground clearance than cars but lower than trucks, and they sit on large, robust wheels, typically with visible wheel arches. Distinctively, the sides of buses often feature a straight or slightly curved lower body line, and they may have advertising panels or distinctive livery patterns and colors, including company logos or route information. The roof may also have features like ventilation units or additional air conditioning systems.
