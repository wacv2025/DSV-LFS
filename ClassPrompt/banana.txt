A banana is distinguished by its elongated, curved shape, typically ranging from 6 to 12 inches in length. The peel is smooth and yellow when ripe, transitioning from green when unripe to brown spots or streaks as it overripens. The banana's cross-section is roughly circular, with a diameter of about 1 to 2 inches, and it tapers towards both ends, more so at the stem end. The peel consists of three to five longitudinal sections that can be easily peeled away from the fruit. Inside, the flesh is creamy white to light yellow, firm but yielding to pressure, and has a slightly glossy surface. Bananas also have small, barely visible seeds embedded in the flesh, typically arranged in a central line. Unlike other fruits, the banana's curvature and vibrant yellow color are highly distinctive, setting it apart from similar elongated fruits like plantains, which are larger, more angular, and have a thicker, green or black peel even when ripe.
