A tennis racket is a lightweight, elongated object characterized by a distinctive oval-shaped head with a network of tightly interwoven strings creating a grid pattern. This stringed head is framed by a thin, flat, and slightly curved rim that typically tapers in width from the top to the throat of the racket, where it meets the handle. The handle itself is a straight, cylindrical grip that is usually wrapped in a textured material to provide a secure hold, and it often features a flared end or butt cap for additional grip stability. The overall structure is symmetrical along its length, and the transition from the head to the handle usually includes a throat area, which can be open or contain a bridge or yoke for added support. The distinct combination of the oval stringed head, slender frame, and straight cylindrical handle with a flared end sets a tennis racket apart from other similar sporting equipment like badminton rackets, which have smaller heads, or squash rackets, which have a different shape and string pattern.
