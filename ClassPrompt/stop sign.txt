A stop sign is a distinctive, octagonal-shaped sign typically characterized by its bright red color and bold white lettering. The red background of the sign is uniformly colored without any patterns or gradients, ensuring high visibility. The word "STOP" is prominently displayed in the center of the sign in all capital letters, written in a sans-serif font. The white letters are large and occupy much of the sign's surface, making them easily readable from a distance. The edges of the sign feature a thin white border that follows the octagonal shape precisely, further enhancing its visibility and distinguishing it from other signs that might be circular or triangular. The sign's reflective surface ensures it remains visible in low light conditions, such as at night or in poor weather, by reflecting headlights or other light sources. This combination of shape, color, and reflective properties is unique to stop signs, setting them apart from other traffic signs and signals.
