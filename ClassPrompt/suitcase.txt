A suitcase typically features a rectangular or box-like shape with rounded corners, designed for carrying personal belongings during travel. Its exterior is usually made from hard or soft materials, such as polycarbonate, fabric, or leather, often with a textured or patterned surface for added durability and style. The front and back panels are usually flat and smooth, sometimes adorned with brand logos or additional pockets. A key distinguishing feature is the presence of a telescoping handle that can be extended for wheeling the suitcase and retracted when not in use. This handle is often accompanied by a pair of sturdy, inline wheels at the bottom, designed to facilitate easy rolling. The top and sometimes the side of the suitcase feature additional fixed handles for carrying by hand. Many suitcases have a zipper or clasp closure system that runs around the edges, often with integrated locks for security. Inside, suitcases are characterized by a spacious main compartment with fabric lining, straps or compartments for organizing clothes and other items, and sometimes mesh or zippered pockets on the interior flaps. The combination of these features especially the telescoping handle, wheels, and specific shape visually distinguishes a suitcase from other similar travel bags like duffel bags or backpacks.
