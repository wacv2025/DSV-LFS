A hair dryer can be visually distinguished from similar objects primarily by its specific design features. Typically, a hair dryer consists of a cylindrical or slightly tapered body with a prominent handle and a nozzle at one end. The body often features a perforated grill or vents for airflow, which is essential for its function. The handle is ergonomically designed for grip and control, often contrasting in texture or color from the main body to enhance usability and visibility. On the body, there are frequently control buttons or switches for adjusting heat and airflow settings, which are clearly marked and distinct in appearance. The nozzle itself is narrow and elongated, sometimes with a distinct shape or curvature depending on the model, facilitating directional airflow during use. These visual characteristics collectively differentiate a hair dryer from other similar objects like handheld vacuum cleaners or electric razors, which have different body shapes, nozzle configurations, and control mechanisms tailored to their respective functions.
