A backpack is typically characterized by its distinct structure, consisting of two shoulder straps that allow it to be worn on the back. It features a rectangular or slightly rounded main compartment, which is usually larger than those found in other similar categories like handbags or satchels. This main compartment often has a zipper or buckle closure at the top or front. Backpacks frequently include additional pockets, both internal and external, with varying closure types such as zippers, buckles, or velcro. The presence of a padded back panel and adjustable padded shoulder straps are notable distinguishing features designed for comfort and ergonomic support. Many backpacks also have a handle at the top for alternative carrying options. They may include compression straps on the sides or bottom, designed to tighten the load, which is not common in other similar objects. Some models feature a front-loading design, allowing easy access to the main compartment from the front rather than the top. Additional elements like reflective strips, hydration reservoir compartments, or external gear attachment points (such as daisy chains or MOLLE webbing) can further differentiate backpacks from other types of bags. The overall size and volume capacity of backpacks are typically larger, suited for carrying more substantial loads, which sets them apart from similar, smaller bag types.
