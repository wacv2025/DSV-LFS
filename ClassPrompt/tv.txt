The TV object class is characterized by a rectangular, flat, and thin display screen that is typically larger in size compared to monitors or computer screens. This screen is encased in a bezel, which can vary in thickness but is usually slim in modern models. TVs often have a larger footprint or stand that provides stability, although some models are designed to be wall-mounted, featuring mounting brackets or holes on the back. Distinguishing features include the presence of multiple ports (HDMI, USB, etc.) on the sides or back for connectivity, along with control buttons and sometimes a built-in tuner visible as small slots or panels. The remote sensor is usually a small, darkened panel on the front or bottom. Compared to other screens, TVs frequently have a broader and more prominent speaker grille, often located at the bottom or along the sides, which might be integrated into the bezel design. Additionally, the TVs size and aspect ratio are often optimized for distance viewing, resulting in a more expansive and immersive display area compared to similar objects like computer monitors.
