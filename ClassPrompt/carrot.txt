A carrot is a root vegetable characterized by its vibrant orange color, although it can occasionally be found in purple, red, yellow, or white hues. It has a tapered, cylindrical shape that typically narrows to a pointed end, with a length that can vary but generally ranges from 4 to 8 inches. The surface of a carrot is smooth yet slightly textured with fine, vertical ridges running along its length. Its skin is thin and can sometimes have a slightly glossy appearance when fresh. Carrots often have small, fine root hairs extending from the main body. At the top, a carrot has a cluster of green, leafy tops known as carrot greens, which are feathery and divided into fine segments, creating a delicate, lace-like appearance. These greens are usually a rich green color and grow in a bushy formation. This combination of a bright orange, tapering body with vertical ridges and thin skin, along with the distinctive green, feathery tops, makes the carrot visually unique among root vegetables.
