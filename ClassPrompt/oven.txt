The oven is visually distinguished by its box-like structure typically made of metal, often stainless steel or enamel-coated, which sets it apart from similar objects like refrigerators or dishwashers. Its front panel features a glass window, allowing observation of the interior, with a handle typically located at the bottom or side. Control knobs or digital displays are prominently positioned on the front, enabling temperature and timer adjustments. On top, a cooktop or burners might be present in some models, characterized by round or square heating elements. The interior cavity, visible through the open door, reveals metal racks for placing trays and dishes. The overall appearance is functional and utilitarian, contrasting with the sleek, often more streamlined designs of other kitchen appliances like microwaves or coffee makers.
