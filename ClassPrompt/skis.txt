Skis are long, narrow, and flat objects typically made from composite materials like fiberglass, metal, and wood. They are uniquely characterized by their elongated and slender shape, often ranging from 150 to 190 centimeters in length and 7 to 15 centimeters in width. Each ski features a gently upward-curving tip, known as the shovel, at the front end, which is distinctively designed to aid in maneuvering and floating on snow. The bottom surface of skis is smooth and slightly concave to provide optimal glide, with a pair of parallel metal edges running along the length for better grip and control on icy surfaces. The top surface usually exhibits a binding system to secure the skier's boots, with two prominent binding mounts visible around the center. Skis often display vibrant and varied graphics or brand logos on their top surfaces, contributing to their distinctive and recognizable appearance. The slight camber or rocker profiles, where the ski slightly curves upwards in the middle or at the ends, further differentiate skis from other similar objects like snowboards or sleds.
