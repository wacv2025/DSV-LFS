A snowboard is a distinctively shaped sports equipment used for snowboarding, easily distinguished from other similar objects by several key visual features. It has a relatively narrow and elongated body with a length typically between 140 to 165 cm and a width that tapers from the middle to the ends. The ends are usually curved upwards, known as the tip (front) and tail (back), which helps in maneuverability on snow. The top surface often features colorful and intricate graphics or brand logos, while the bottom surface, which is smooth and flat, is designed for gliding over snow. Snowboards also have a slight concave shape across their width to aid in edge control. Bindings are attached to the top surface of the snowboard, which are essential for securing the rider's boots to the board; these bindings can be visually distinguished as raised structures with straps or clips, positioned symmetrically along the snowboard's length. The edges of the snowboard are made of metal and are sharpened to cut through the snow, adding a visible, shiny metallic outline around the board's perimeter. These features collectively give the snowboard a sleek, aerodynamic, and sporty appearance, setting it apart from other boards such as skateboards or surfboards.
