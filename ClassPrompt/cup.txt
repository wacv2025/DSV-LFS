A cup, as a distinct object class, typically features a cylindrical or slightly tapered shape, often with a smooth surface and a uniform, symmetrical design. Its key distinguishing visual feature is the presence of a handle, which is usually attached to the side of the cup's body, facilitating easy gripping. The handle can vary in shape, from a simple loop to more intricate designs, but it is always prominent. Cups generally have a flat base to ensure stability when placed on a surface. The rim of a cup is often slightly flared or rounded to facilitate drinking. Cups are usually made of ceramic, glass, or plastic, and can be decorated with various patterns, colors, or images, though the basic structure remains recognizable. The size of a cup is generally smaller and more delicate compared to mugs, distinguishing it from other similar objects like bowls or mugs. Cups may have a thinner wall compared to mugs, contributing to their lighter appearance and feel.
