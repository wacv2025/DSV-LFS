The background object class is characterized by a lack of distinct, focal features that typically define other object categories. Unlike objects with clear, sharp boundaries and identifiable shapes, background elements are often diffuse, blending seamlessly into the environment. They exhibit a wide range of textures, from smooth to rough, but these textures do not form recognizable patterns. Colors in the background class tend to be more muted or gradient-like, without strong, contrasting edges. The lighting on background objects is generally even, avoiding the pronounced highlights and shadows that make foreground objects stand out. Backgrounds can include elements such as the sky, ground, walls, or distant scenery, all of which share a common trait of providing context rather than serving as the primary focus of attention. They often lack symmetry and detailed structural components, appearing more as a continuous spread rather than discrete entities. This diffuse nature, combined with their contextual role, visually differentiates background objects from the more defined, isolated shapes of foreground categories.A traffic light is a pole-mounted or overhead device used to control vehicle and pedestrian traffic flow at intersections. It typically features a vertical or horizontal arrangement of circular lights housed within a rectangular or cylindrical casing. The lights are distinctively colored in a universally recognized sequence: red at the top, yellow in the middle, and green at the bottom. The lights may emit a steady or flashing signal, with each color indicating a specific action: red for stop, yellow for caution or prepare to stop, and green for go. The casing is often black or dark gray to provide high contrast against the brightly illuminated lights, and it is designed to be weather-resistant with a smooth, durable surface. Some traffic lights may include visors or hoods above each light to shield them from sunlight and improve visibility. Additionally, modern traffic lights might have LED lights, making them appear more intense and energy-efficient compared to traditional incandescent bulbs. The pole or structure supporting the traffic light is typically made of metal, often painted in a neutral color like black, gray, or green, to blend with urban infrastructure, and may include additional elements like pedestrian signals, cameras, or signage. The geometric, color-coded light arrangement and its specific sequence, along with its strategic placement at intersections, make the traffic light highly distinguishable from other objects in the urban environment.
