A tie, typically worn around the neck and under the collar of a shirt, is characterized by its long, narrow, and flexible form, usually tapering to a point at one end and broadening at the other. Unlike scarves or ascots, a tie's length is consistent, with a distinctive knot at the neck. The material is often smooth and shiny, made from silk or polyester, setting it apart from the coarser textures of scarves or the elaborate patterns of bow ties. The tie drapes straight down the torso, unlike bow ties which are symmetrically horizontal, or cravats which are more fabric-intensive and often intricately folded. Ties feature a consistent width throughout their length, narrowing or broadening slightly based on style, unlike bolo ties, which consist of a cord with an ornamental clasp. The patterns on ties can be varied but are typically repetitive and formal, such as stripes, solids, or small geometric shapes, unlike the often larger and more varied designs found on ascots and scarves. Additionally, ties are distinctly associated with the structure and aesthetic of formal wear, specifically suited to the traditional necktie knot and tailored appearance of suits, distinguishing them visually and contextually from other neckwear.
