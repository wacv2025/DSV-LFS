A couch, also known as a sofa, is characterized by its substantial, often rectangular, upholstered structure designed primarily for seating multiple people. Distinguishing features include its sizable frame, which typically extends horizontally and is supported by four or more short legs. The backrest is usually tall, spanning the entire width of the couch, and is cushioned, often with a gentle slope or slight curvature for ergonomic support. The seat cushions are broad and deep, providing ample space for reclining, and are usually removable or at least distinct from the couch's main frame. Armrests are present on either end, which are padded and may vary in height and width but generally align with the backrest's height. The upholstery can vary widely in material, from fabric to leather, but it consistently covers the entire structure, including the back, seat, and armrests. Additionally, a couch often has decorative elements such as tufting, buttons, or stitched patterns on the cushions and backrest. These features distinguish a couch from other seating options like chairs, which are designed for fewer people, and benches, which typically lack the same level of cushioning and upholstered structure.
