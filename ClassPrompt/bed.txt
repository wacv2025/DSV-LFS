A bed is characterized by its distinctive structure, typically consisting of a flat horizontal surface designed for lying down, supported by a sturdy frame. The mattress, often rectangular, is a key feature, usually thicker and more cushioned than surfaces found on similar objects like sofas or couches. Beds often include a headboard, which can vary in style but is generally taller and more prominent than any backrest on a sofa. They might also feature a footboard, which is shorter and located at the opposite end of the headboard. The legs of a bed are usually shorter and less visible than those on couches, contributing to its low-profile appearance. The overall design is geared towards spaciousness, with the width and length tailored to accommodate a single person or multiple individuals lying down horizontally, distinguishing it from seats that support sitting positions. Beds can also have visible bedding components like sheets, pillows, and blankets, which are more abundant and varied in texture and pattern compared to minimalistic cushions found on other furniture. This combination of a thick mattress, headboard, footboard, low-profile frame, and ample bedding accessories distinctly identifies the bed as a unique object class.
