A traffic light, typically found at road intersections, is characterized by its vertical or horizontal rectangular shape, usually encased in a metal or plastic housing that is often black or dark gray. The most distinguishing feature is its series of three circular lenses or lights, aligned either vertically or horizontally. These lights are universally colored red, yellow (amber), and green. The red light is positioned at the top (or left in horizontal configurations), followed by the yellow in the middle, and the green at the bottom (or right). Each lens has a frosted or ridged surface designed to diffuse the light. The lights are usually enclosed within a visor or hood, extending slightly outward, which helps reduce glare and improve visibility. Traffic lights are often mounted on poles or hung from wires, and may include additional arrows or symbols indicating specific traffic directions. The presence of these three specific colors in a precise order, combined with their distinct circular lenses and the surrounding housing, makes traffic lights uniquely distinguishable from other street fixtures or signs.
